Implementation Summary
I've created all the necessary files for the VS Code Notepad application according to the PRD requirements. Let me explain what each file does and how to get started:
Project Structure

Express Application: Set up with Pug templating engine
Bootstrap Integration: Designed to be included from the public folder (not NPM)
UI Components: Navbar, Sidebar, and Main Content Area implemented as specified
Theming: Both light and dark themes implemented in CSS

Key Files Created

layout.pug: The base template for all pages
index.pug: The main notepad interface with all required components
style.css: Custom styling with both light and dark theme support
theme-toggle.js: Prepared for future implementation of theme switching
routes/index.js: Simple route to render the main page
app.js: Express application configuration

Getting Started

Set up the Express project using the commands in the "Project Setup Commands" artifact
Download Bootstrap files (CSS and JS) and place them in the public/bootstrap directory
Copy all the code files into their respective locations in the project
Run npm install to install dependencies
Run npm start to start the application
Access the application at http://localhost:3000

Features Implemented

✅ Responsive UI with Bootstrap
✅ Navbar with application title
✅ Sidebar with "New Note" and "Delete Note" buttons
✅ Note list placeholder area
✅ Title input and content textarea
✅ Save button
✅ Both light and dark themes (though theme switching will be implemented later)

This implementation satisfies all requirements for Stage 1 of the PRD, focusing solely on the UI structure without any backend functionality. All the UI components are in place, and the application is ready for Stage 2 development, which will add backend and data storage functionality.
